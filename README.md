## 👨‍💻 Developer: Sami Ur Rehman

A collection of beginner-level C++ programs built during my first semester of the Computer Programming course. These projects reflect my journey from basic syntax to logic building, simulations, and structured problem solving. Each file represents a milestone in learning how to think like a programmer.
